## Challenge Description:

Welcome to the "Shaping Real-Time with React" hackathon! In this creative coding competition, we invite you to harness the power of React to craft unique, real-time experiences centered around the ever-flowing river of time.

### Challenge Objective:

Your mission is to design and build a React application that makes innovative use of the current date and time. Your project can be whimsical, functional, artistic, or even a little bit of everything, as long as it showcases your creativity or imagination.

### Challenge Requirements:

- Real-Time Display: Your React application must display the current date and/or time.

How to Participate:

- Register: Sign up for the hackathon and form teams if you wish (individual entries are also welcome). Maximum of 3 members per team 

- Hack: Start coding your React application, making sure to meet the challenge requirements. You have the flexibility to decide whether to include user interaction or not.

- Submit: Once your project is ready, submit it with a brief description of its features and functionality.  The code should be available in GitHub (public repository).

- Demo: Present your project to our panel of judges and fellow participants during the demo session.

### Judging Criteria:

- Creativity: How creative/innovative is your React application?

- Functionality: Does your application accurately display the date and time?

- User Experience: How user-friendly and engaging is your application?

## Getting Started with this Template
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
